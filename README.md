# Hack@NeuroData main website


## Running the webserver
Because the website uses absolute paths, you cannot access it from the `file:///` protocol. Instead, to run it you will need to run the following from the repos root directory:

```bash
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000
```

Then go to http://localhost:8000/ to visit your development version of the site.


By the end of the tutorial, @jovo will be able to do all the issues, without actually speaking to anybody
